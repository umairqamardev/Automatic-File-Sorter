# Automatic-File-Sorter

This Python script is designed to automatically organize your files into neat categories based on their file types. If you're tired of manually sorting files, this script does the job for you in seconds!

How It Works:
Automated Sorting: The script scans the specified folder and categorizes files into subfolders based on their extension.
Folder Creation: It creates folders for .csv, .png, and .txt files if they donâ€™t already exist.
Duplicate Handling: The script checks if a file with the same name already exists in the target folder and avoids duplication by skipping files that are already sorted.
Features:
Moves .csv files to a folder called csv files.
Moves .png files to a folder called image files.
Moves .txt files to a folder called text files.
Why Use It?
Save Time: No more manual dragging and dropping files into folders.
Stay Organized: Your files are neatly categorized without lifting a finger.
Simple & Efficient: Just set your folder path, run the script, and watch the magic happen!
Usage:
Set the path variable to the folder where your files are located.
Run the script, and it will automatically sort everything into the respective folders.
